Recommendations for watching anime you can. There are many different types of anime that can be enjoyed, so it really depends on what you&rsquo;re looking for in an anime. While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:

-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=winter-2022-anime-rankings--week-11---anime-corner>Winter 2022 Anime Rankings – Week 11 - Anime Corner<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#winter-2022-anime-rankings--week-11---anime-corner>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://animecorner.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Winter-2022-Anime-Rankings-Week-11.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.t_whB69AYaIBOLV97x5a2wHaLH&pid=15.1"' alt="Winter 2022 Anime Rankings – Week 11 - Anime Corner"><p><em>Source: animecorner.me</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li>lavender</li></ol><h2 id=where-do-the-colts-rank-week-7-2019>Where Do The Colts Rank?
