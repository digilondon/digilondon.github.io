-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=inktober-original-drawing---edward-scissorhands-9x1075-by>INKtober Original Drawing - Edward Scissorhands 9x10.75 By<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#inktober-original-drawing---edward-scissorhands-9x1075-by>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f1/cc/b4/f1ccb4f56fe6d78c7dcf1038d2f92968.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xcOvewM5visnXxtULeqeCQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="INKtober original drawing - Edward Scissorhands 9x10.75 by"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>scissorhands edward inktober.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Anime: Animation, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sports, and more
